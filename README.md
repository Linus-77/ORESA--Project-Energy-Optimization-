# Household Energy Consumption Simulation  
**Modeling the Impact of User Behavior and Smart Technology using Linopy**

## Project Overview
This project analyzes residential energy consumption using **linear programming** with the **Linopy** library in Python. It simulates hourly energy demand based on behavioral patterns (e.g., careless vs. efficient users) and the integration of smart technologies. The goal is to explore energy optimization and cost/emission reductions in household settings.

Developed as part of the *Operations Research for Energy Systems Application* course at **Ruhr-Universität Bochum**.
